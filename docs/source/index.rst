The Distributed Computing Library (dislib) provides distributed algorithms ready
to use as a library. So far, dislib is highly focused on machine learning
algorithms, and is greatly inspired by `Scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn
.org>`_. However, other types of numerical algorithms might be added in the
future. The main objective of dislib is to facilitate the execution of big
data analytics algorithms in distributed platforms, such as clusters, clouds,
and supercomputers.

Dislib has been implemented on top of `PyCOMPSs <https://www.bsc
.es/research-and-development/software-and-apps/software-list/comp-superscalar
/>`_ programming model, and it is being developed by the `Workflows
and Distributed Computing <https://www.bsc
.es/discover-bsc/organisation/scientific-structure/workflows-and-distributed
-computing>`_ group of the `Barcelona Supercomputing Center <http://www.bsc
.es>`_.
